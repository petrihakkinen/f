- error location visualization works really bad with long loaded files such as mandel.f

- allow using control flow words outside colon definitions?

- format negative hex values as two's complement

- LIST, R@, LEAVE, UNLOOP

- rename >R -> PUSH, R> -> POP ?

- ,S or something for enclosing strings into dictionary (are space terminated strings ok?)
